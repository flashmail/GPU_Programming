## Project: GPU Programming - 100 Days of CUDA & GPU Kernels

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of GPU kernel implementations
spanning over 100 days of GPU programming challenges, including CUDA, HIP, and
Triton-based implementations. The work covers fundamental linear algebra operations,
machine learning algorithms, neural network layers, optimization techniques, and
advanced GPU computing patterns.

The code is provided as educational material for GPU programming learning, research,
and development purposes. All kernels are optimized for parallel execution and
demonstrate best practices in GPU memory management, thread organization, and
performance optimization.
